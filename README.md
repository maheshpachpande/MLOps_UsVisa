# MLOps_UsVisa
- A comprehensive MLOps pipeline that automates model training, validation, deployment, and monitoring with CI/CD integration, feature stores, experiment tracking, and real-time performance monitoring to enable scalable, reliable machine learning operations in production environments.
- "PyPI (Python Package Index) is the official repository for Python packages, allowing developers to publish and install reusable code libraries to streamline development and promote modularity."
- A well-organized project FOLDER STRUCTURE with packages is essential to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability of code in a production-ready machine learning pipeline.


### template.py
- The script automates the creation of a well-structured Python project directoryâ€”especially useful for machine learning or backend applications. It ensures all required folders and files exist, and it does so safely, cleanly, and idempotently (can run multiple times without harm).

### "Ensure the project runs exactly the same today, tomorrow, and on another machine."
### Create Conda Environment (Basic Command)
- conda create --name us_visa_env python=3.10 -y
- conda activate us_visa_env

### setup.py
- It makes a Python project installable, reusable, and ready for distribution or deployment by defining its metadata and dependencies.
- requirements.txt (pip install -r requirements.txt)
- The -r flag is required to indicate you want pip to install from a requirements file, not a single package by that name. It helps automate dependency management and maintain consistency across environments.
- What Does -e . Mean? -- e stands for editable. -- . refers to the current directory (where setup.py is located).
