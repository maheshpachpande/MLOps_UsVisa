# MLOps_UsVisa
A comprehensive MLOps pipeline that automates model training, validation, deployment, and monitoring with CI/CD integration, feature stores, experiment tracking, and real-time performance monitoring to enable scalable, reliable machine learning operations in production environments.



### template.py
- The script automates the creation of a well-structured Python project directoryâ€”especially useful for machine learning or backend applications. It ensures all required folders and files exist, and it does so safely, cleanly, and idempotently (can run multiple times without harm).

### "Ensure the project runs exactly the same today, tomorrow, and on another machine."
### Create Conda Environment (Basic Command)
- conda create --name us_visa_env python=3.10 -y
- conda activate us_visa_env
